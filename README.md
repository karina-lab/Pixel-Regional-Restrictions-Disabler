# Pixel Regional Restrictions Disabler

A Magisk Module to enable VoLTE, VoWiFi, 5G, UWB, 5/6 GHz hotspot & Wi-Fi repeater for Google Pixel in countries not officially supported by Google.

This is an all-in-one mod for convenience.

Tested on Pixel 8 Pro. Should work on others too.

Note that UWB is available only for Pro models. 

## Features

In [unsupported countries](https://pixel.withgoogle.com/5G/) for the Google Pixel, this module enables and gives you:

- VoLTE
- VoWiFi (Wi-Fi calling)
- 5G (SA+NSA)
- 5 GHz & 6 GHz hotspot
- Wi-Fi repeater (hotspot while connected to Wi-Fi)
- UWB (Pro models only)

## Requirements

- Google Pixel 6 or higher (Google Silicon)
- Rooted with Magisk / KernelSU / Apatch
- A brain

## Installation

Download the zip from the [release page](https://github.com/karina-lab/Pixel-Regional-Restrictions-Disabler/releases) and flash it using Magisk / KernelSU / Apatch.

Reboot your phone.

You're done!

Remember to enable VoLTE, VoWiFi, 5G & UWB in your device settings.

You also need to enable hotspot once after installing the module for new options to show up.
